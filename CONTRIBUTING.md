# Contributing to Dembrandt

Dembrandt reveals any website’s brand the way Rembrandt revealed light from shadow... color, typography, tone, emotion, and drama in seconds.

De-em-brand-t is the smartest way to dissect a brand, design system and design tokens from any website. Useful for various use cases.

I’m @thevangelist, the slightly crazy guy behind it.

Stargazers, dreamers, bug hunters — I welcome you all.

Please tell me about:

- Bugs you found
- Weird websites that make it cry
- Pull requests (even one-liners make me happy)
- Open a discussion, I’ll talk to you, promise
- Graphic design workflow ideas
- Dev workflow pain
- Missing design tokens
- Marketing–design–dev chaos
- Design systems you love/hate
- How to use more AI without selling our souls
- Tone of voice obsessions
- How you wish to use this thing
- Your latest dream (or nightmare)

I am quite easy to work with. Really.  
Spam me in Issues, PRs, or anywhere. I reply to everything.

Let’s keep the light alive together.
